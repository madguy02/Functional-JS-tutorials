Higher Order functions
-------------
A higher order function is a function, that does at least one of the following :

> **points:**

> - Take one or more functions as an input.
> - Output a function

* All other functions are first order functions.

#### Further Explanation
In javascript we have "first-class-functions". Unlike other programming languages.
First Class functions means that you can treat functions (in javascript) just like String or Number.
Thus giving you the adavantage of using function in the same manner. We can store functions as variables,
properties of an object and also pass as arguments to other functions.
